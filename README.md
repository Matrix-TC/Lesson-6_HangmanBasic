# Homework:

In this game, the computer will choose a random word, and the player has to guess the word one letter at a time. The player can guess a letter, and if it's in the word, the computer will reveal the position(s) of the letter in the word. The player has a limited number of guesses, and if they don't guess the word before they run out of guesses, they lose.
